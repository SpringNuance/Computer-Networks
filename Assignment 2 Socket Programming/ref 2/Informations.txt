Server Code : 

We have 2 classes : 

	Server class : 
		Init server function : 

		Initialisation de la classe : Port, List of thread clients, Adress server, Backlog is number of client which can connected to the server chat at the same time 
		
		Run server function :

		A loop who created the socket and define the socket (port + IP adress server chat) 
		In fact the main goal of the server is to listen the port and manage incoming information (send message + new client which would like to conect to the server chat)
		The server accept the new client 
		For each client who are connected to the chat, the server manage the creation of the thread clients and then add the thread to the list of client thread
		
		Client class : 
		Traitement des thread client cote server. The server decode all received informations  which come from the right thread client
		According to the messages received by the server, the server executes a particular task 
		For example when a new user are connected to the chat, the server send a message to all other user in order to notify them that a new user has joined the chat 
		
		Manage the thread of each client which are conntected to the server 
			One thread for each client 
			10 clients allow to connect the server chat		
		
	Client class : 
		
		One infity loop who receive and then decode all message who he receives and the print the message
		One infity loop who for send message : Encode the message and the send it to the server 
		The loop stop when the client type QUIT in the python console
		The main of this classe : 
			- create socket 
			- Print message of each command that the user can use 


In fact the major treatment is done server side
